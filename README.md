# Cryptography Tool

This project provides a collection of functions to perform encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis on texts using substitution and Vigenère ciphers.

## Features

- **Substitution Cipher:** Encrypt and decrypt text using a substitution dictionary.
- **Vigenère Cipher:** Encrypt and decrypt text using a Vigenère cipher with a provided password.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Predict substitution dictionaries based on frequency analysis.
- **Vigenère Cipher Analysis:** Estimate password length and derive the password.

## Usage

To run the program:
```bash
python main.py
